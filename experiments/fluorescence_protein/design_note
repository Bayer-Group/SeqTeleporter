For HEK
Yes, I would use the pMC3025 (pTT5). That is a backbone with CMV promoter and pA
the 5´ cloning site includes part of the start codon (CCAT)
and 3´ cloning site includes the stop codon (TAAT)
No leader peptide for secretion in the vector, but I guess you do not need one


E.coli T7 construct:

pAL26162 (T7 promoter)
pAL26164 (T7 RBS)
pAL22805 (T7 terminator)
pAL26962 (backbone)
